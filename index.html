        <p>For many families in the United States, there’s an expectation of attending a college level institution after high school. However, the decision of where, depends on both academic merit, financial aid and affordability as well.</p>

        <p>The cost of applying to college, with the rise in tuition and fees, creates a heavy burden for many students and their families. U.S universities’ tuition and fees have increased from 2020, the Covid-19 Pandemic Era, to 2024, showing the breadth of this financial strain.</p>

        <p>“Prices for college tuition and fees increased 4.7 percent from February 2020 to February 2023,” said the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2023/college-tuition-and-fees-up-4-7-percent-since-february-2020.htm"> U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>.</p>

      <iframe  title="United States Universities Fee Percent Change Statewide from 2020-2024" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-ba32Q" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ba32Q/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: ;" height="725" data-external="1"></iframe>

        <p>Michelle Dzulynsky, mother of Christian and Aure Dzulynsky, said “…the application fees were horrible  - typically anywhere from $50-$75”.</p>
        
        <p>With the competitiveness of institutions, prospective students cast wider nets in hope of more acceptance letters. Which results in those students having to pay anywhere from hundreds to thousands of dollars in application fees.</p>
        
        <p>According to Dzulynsky, she spent “around $500 for application fees,” she said. These costs don’t include the extra fees for sending ACT and SAT scores and the travel that comes with campus tours and visits.</p>
        
        <p>Dzulynsky said, Christian applied to universities at the end of 2019 right before the Covid-19 Pandemic hit. His sister, Aure Dzulynsky, began to apply in 2024 and her financial experience mirrored his, she said.</p>
        
        <p>Dzulynsky said she hired a college advisor for her daughter, Aure, and though she applied to fewer schools, the rate of the extra fees remained high between test scores and application fees.</p>

        <p>Many families don’t consider the extra fees and costs when their child applies to universities, and it often evolves past what they expected. Dzulynsky said that for both of her children, the expenses surpassed what she originally had imagined.<p>

        <p>Many schools have the option of waiving the application fees if students need, yet that’s not always possible. Students often need certain need-based qualifications to be eligible, but not all institutions offer fee waivers. The substantial fee prices can add hardship to families, way before having to pay a full tuition.<p>

      <iframe title="United States Universities Tuition Percent Change Statewide from 2020-2024" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-iCZr7" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/iCZr7/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="725" data-external="1"></iframe>

        <p>Data from the <a href="https://nces.ed.gov">National Center for Education Statistics</a> shows that the average tuition increase from 2020 to 2024 has been considerable. For example, <a href="https://www.georgetown.edu/admissions/">Georgetown University</a> raised their average tuition from $57,384 in the 2020-2021 academic year to $64,896 in the 2023-2024 academic year; creating a 13.09% increase.<p>

        <p>Similarly <a href="https://www.bu.edu/admissions/tuition-aid/"> Boston University</a> increased their average tuition by 12.48% from their starting point at $56,854 in 2020 to $63,798. This increase in just four years combined with the increase in number of applicants each year reflects the financial complications, especially on those who already struggle with application costs and fees.<p>

        <p>Nationally many 4-year institutions have raised their tuition to match inflation to recover from the economic impact of the pandemic.<p>

        <p> <a href="https://www.northwestern.edu">Northwestern University</a> raised their average tuition by 11.44%, while <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=brown+universtiiy&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8">Brown University</a> raised their average tuition by more than 10%. These tuition increases are consistent with the broad spectrum of institutions all across the United States, which, historically, has outpaced general inflation.<p>

      <iframe title="The Percent Change of Tuition at 10 of the Top Institutions in the United States" aria-label="Grouped Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-wtJIR" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/wtJIR/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="950" data-external="1"></iframe>

        <p>Tuition increases are matched by their equally increased additional fees, which further increases the cost of attendance at these college institutions.<p>
        
        <p>For instance, <a href="https://degrees.snhu.edu/?utm_campaign=PFBranded&pfsegment=BR&utm_source=google&utm_medium=pdsearch&utm_content=619164998862&snhu_segment=ol&adkeyword=southern%20new%20hampshire%20university&admatchtype=e&addevice=c&adnetwork=g&adcampaignid=314119401&adcampaignname=G:Brand_General:NY&adgroupid=24994601001&adgroupname=Southern-New-Hampshire-University-ONLY-EXACT-BRAND-GENERAL:NY&adlocationid=9005169&adplacement=&venpubid=ppcbrand&gclsrc=aw.ds&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=314119401&gbraid=0AAAAADxyPDfRfv2eSS9tdjcRisrw6N_YV&gclid=Cj0KCQjwt8zABhDKARIsAHXuD7bZGorYiBcCntgwTQ9kdyt04Qx9E5rFgjZn8Ztp5Kzl3KMXxjgimHMaAoExEALw_wcB"> Southern New Hampshire University </a> saw a rise in their fees from $50 to $1000, a 1900% increase. Similar fee spikes occurred at universities across the country. <a href="https://www.gwu.edu"> George Washington University</a> experienced a 222.22% spike in fees.<p>
        
        <p>Scholarships can remove some of this financial strain on families, but most of the time they don’t fully cover the cost of tuition.<p>

        <p>According to Dzulynsky, her son committed to <a href="https://www.chapman.edu">Chapman University</a> in the state of California in 2020. The private 4-year institution gave him a scholarship.<p>
        
        <p>“[T]uition during Christian’s time was $27K a semester for a full-time student,” with a scholarship Dzulynsky recalled.<p>
        
        <p>Similarly, Dzulynsky’s daughter, Aure, received a scholarship to <a href="https://degrees.nau.edu/online-landing/?utm_source=Google&utm_campaign=EMS_GGPS%7CBrand&trackid=0D1D77BC-18C8-4867-B5A2-10FB6B403F80&utm_medium=cpc&utm_content=c_NAU&utm_term=p_northern%20arizona%20university&adid=743783161330&gclid=Cj0KCQjwt8zABhDKARIsAHXuD7ZYCdjVphK3zlUz-uIuGv_4k73v9vmjrsUsKJFAeoggOx9EvCROTL0aAubQEALw_wcB&lead_source=Paid_Search&vendor_id=EDDY&referral_source=Google&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=20518214830&gbraid=0AAAAAC_lVS-pybJjYVLINBY4dM0fDwmOX"> Northern Arizona University</a>. Dzulynsky mentioned that her daughter got into the honors program which increased the tuition further.<p>
        
        <p>“[T]he honors fee is an additional $360 per semester…honors tuition is around $20,500 per semester, then add maybe $500 for books, $6000 for food, $16K for housing – probably around $50k-ish per year…” said Dzulynsky, “then factor in her scholarship, I think she comes in around $38k’ she said.<p>
        
        <p>According to Dzulynsky, the reason college tuition and fee costs are increasing directly relates to the aftermath of the pandemic.<p>

        <p>“I think initially the schools were slow to increase costs because they knew everyone was bouncing back financially but that last year maybe a year or two…somewhere around 2023, costs just started riding up,” said Dzulynsky.<p>
        
        <p>Overall, with the increase in applications and competitive acceptance rates from universities, the cost of attendance and additional fees may continue to climb.<p>
